Artificial Intelligence Assignment 2

Cole Peppis and Ben Stern

We have adhered to the Honor Code in this assignment.

Design decisions we want you to know about:
    In our Kalah.java, we structured our minimax proceedure as two functions,
mini and maxi in order to make it flow more intuitively for us. We used this to
our advantage when modelling the go again mechanic. When a player gets a free
turn mini or maxi simply calls itself again with the same depth in order to
avoid incorrectly evaluating a node. It doesn't make sense to us to stop in the
middle of a turn and evaluate the board. This is sound because turns are always
finite so our algorithm will never loop forever.
